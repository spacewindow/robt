        <p>Playground XYZ offer a full-service mobile advertising platform, where advertisers can create and deploy mobile advertising campaigns.</p>
        <p>Our online platform required a Reporting Dashboard for clients to monitor and gain insights on the performance of their ad placements. I designed and prototyped the <strong>Campaigns Listing </strong> and <strong>Reporting and Analytics</strong>          screens.</p>

      <h2>Campaigns Listing</h2>
      <p>Playground customers are usually managing multiple ad campaigns at once, each containing multiple ad creatives and audience targetting.</p>
      <p>My challenge was to provide users with immediate insight into the performance of their campaigns on login.</p>

      <h2>Reporting and Analytics</h2>
      <p>We wanted to provide customers with custom, easily comprehensible visualisations of their Campaign Data.</p>
      <p>We also aimed to provide some basic analytics controls, so the data could be split and viewed in a number of ways to gain deeper insights on campaign performance, such as which targetted audience was responding most to the ads based on clicks or
        engagement.
