        <p>We knew from our campaign data that users are reluctant to share their location with brands.</p>

        <p>The ad unit would engage users incrementally:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Estimate user location using Google Geolocation, then use Search to fetch a list of nearby locations to make a purchase.</li>
          <li>Display the locations in a custom Google map styled match the brand.</li>
          <li>The customer could control whether to refine their location, or open up directions in the Maps app or web browser.</li>
