        <p>Currently <strong>UX Designer</strong> for award-winning mobile advertising startup <a href="#">PLAYGROUND XYZ</a>, where I design and prototype digital advertising products. Lead designer for Reporting and Analytics for their online platform.</p>

        <h3>I Sketch and code.</h3>

        <p>Though I use Sketch and Photoshop daily, I lean towards 'designing in the browser'. I use advanced skills in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>Javascript</strong> to quickly iterate towards moving, functioning prototypes
          that lay the groundwork for final development.</p>

        <h3>A visual touch.</h3>

        <p>Originally a graphic designer and animator, I know the value of engaging people in your product through meaningful motion design and visual flair that delights.</p>

        <h3>Digital design for humans.</h3>

        <p>I am a naturally empathetic person, and user needs a constant companion throughout the design process. I have experience conducting user research at project inception, and user testing at different stages in the project.</p>
